Diffeomorphic deformations for shape matching
=============================================

`ddmatch` is a software library for [image registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration), and more generally [shape matching](http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~younes/CA.html), in Python. It uses diffeomorphisms to warp a template shape into a target shape. Images are treated as if they were [probability densities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function).
