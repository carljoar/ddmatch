`ddmatch`: Diffeomorphic deformations for shape matching
========================================================

`ddmatch` is a software library for [image registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration) in Python. It uses diffeomorphisms to warp a source image into a target image, treating the images as if they were [probability densities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function).
